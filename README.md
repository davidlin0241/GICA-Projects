Cellular Automata https://cs61c.org/hw/hw2/ A cellular automata starts with a row of cells. Each cell is either alive (‘1’) or dead (‘0’). At discrete time steps, the automata “evolves”, producing a new generation, which we represent as a new row. We decide whether each cell in the next generation is alive or dead using a “rule”.

Performance Programming https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa19/hw/hw9/ Optimizing a function by unrolling, SIMD, and OpenMP

Mandelbrot https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa19//projects/proj1/ Implementing the Mandelbrot function and translating the result to an image

Classify https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa19//projects/proj2/ Creating a simple Artificial Neural Net (ANN), which will be able to classify handwritten digits to their actual number
